## Paper summary
Over-harvesting is increasingly recognised as a critical issue for people and communities that rely on bushmeat for proteins or for income. The implementation of wildlife abundance monitoring tools could help to achieve a sustainable exploitation of animal populations. We investigate the use of distance sampling methodologies to document baseline animal population densities of forest-dwelling species as a first step towards evidence-based management of bushmeat stocks. The animals may commonly avoid the transects from which they are surveyed, leading to a negative bias in the estimates of population densities. This negative bias would then lead to over-pessimistic population viability analyses. We used a combination of simulations and transect survey data of blue duikers (Philantomba monticola) collected in the Lomako wildlife reserve in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to illustrate these points. We recommend recording both the forward and perpendicular distances routinely when detecting an animal, implementing multiple-observer protocols, and repeating the surveys multiple times per season. We warn that sometimes the propensity of animals to avoid the transects is too strong to apply distance sampling. We also outline the general principles of a local stakeholder-based program combining distance sampling with less intensive types of ecological indicators.
